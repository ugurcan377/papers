Papers
======

This repo contains my written works as an academic paper or otherwise

I have currently written two papers.

1. Distributed File Systems (Turkish) also published by Çankaya University.  
   For reference: Ergun, U. et al. (2013), "Güncel Dağıtık Dosya Sistemlerinin Karşılaştırmalı Analizi", 6. Mühendislik ve Teknoloji Sempozyumu,Ankara,Turkey

2. Paralel Programming with Functional Programming Languages (Turkish) as my license thesis

Please notice that they are my first attempts to write a paper. There might be some mistakes and missing parts.  
All feedback is welcome, peer review rocks :)
